I am a passionate and dedicated full-stack developer with years of experience specializing in JS, Typescript, React, and Node. I love what I do, and my enthusiasm shines through in every project I undertake. While
I have a diverse range of skills, including backend development, infra management, architectural solutions, and DevOps practices, my true passion lies with UX and UI.
